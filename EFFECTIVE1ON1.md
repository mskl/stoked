# Effective 1on1s
> **Effective 1on1 is not about you**, but about the other person.
- **Effective feedback is regular, specific and fair. Your goal is to build a culture of giving and receiving feedback regularly.** This creates security and trust between all parties and allows people to grow.
- Use the Non-Violent Communication (NVC) framework: What happened, How I felt, Relation to my Values, Specific Actions.
- Recognition should be timely and specific.
- Recipe for weekly 15 minute 1on1. Block this as 30 min in your calendar to allow 5 min for preparation (write-down goals prior to the talk) and 10 min if you over-extend.
    - **smalltalk** (5min): How are you, how are you feeling, how have you been, what are you looking forward to.
    - **the meat** (7min): Start by setting agenda. Can be driven by both parties. Place to discuss important stuff, give feedback,..
    - **wrapup** (3min): Repeat actionable goals. Use this to improve the your skills. "Is there anything I could help you with?" (unblock, enable you,..). Solicit feedback: "Give me one point that you like about our org (me) and one that we (I) can improve."
