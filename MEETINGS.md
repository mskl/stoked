# Effective Meetings

Inspired by [Cinkatko podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5iGouoclDRZga0UwvfkjM1?si=97f2a7a681394e6e) with Jirka Janousek (ex-Aimful).

> Bad meetings are not issue of the bad meeting itself. It is a consequence of bad culture. And you can't fix a bad culture by changing some meeting practice by adding agenda.

1on1s are mutual teaching and exchange of information. They should be regarded as the subordinate's meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him. The supervisor is there to learn and coach. Feedback must be integral to the progress. If you don't know how well you are performing, how can you get better?

## Problems and Lessons Learned

Meeting is a complex system of politics. Not just about the content or that people need to solve stuff. People don't come to the meeting just to share information, but for politics, to enable, to block, to distribute responsibility and more.

> If the meeting had agenda, it would be much better.

That is bullshit. Zero impact to the meeting quality and amount of meetings.

In the end, everything that matters is the person that organizes the meeting. Is he your boss? Meetings are very sensitive thing that have whole social dynamic around them. People want to believe that the issue is the missing agenda.

> This should have been an email.

Bullshit, same people that say this don't read emails.

> People would care if they realised how much it costs.

The only person that cares about the cost of the meeting is the founder. Nobody else cares. You need to have a process to buy network cable, but you can easily invite 20 people for an hour meeting and nobody cares.

## Make Meetings Great
Realise that meetings are costly and hire a facilitator. He holds you accountable for your deadlines and actions. He has right to jump into your speech to kill you. He has 5 points to cover and that's his responsibility. In case of topic overspill, make some actionable points and move rest to the next meeting.

> We have open door policy etc. Anybody can reject a meeting.

Bullshit, there is a norm. Nobody wants to put himself into unpleasant situation of rejecting a meeting.

Leadership needs to be role models and have self-reflection. As a leader, instead of expecting that people will reject meetings, a great tactic is to ask "*Why are you here?*". And if they don't know why they came, confront the people why the fuck are they in the meeting and hadn't canceled it.

## Questions to Ask
- What are you working on?
- How are you doing; how are your OKRs coming along?
- Is there anything impeding your work?
- What do you need from me to be more successfull?
- How do you need to grow to achieve your career goals?
- What's working well? What's not working well?
- What makes you very happy?
- What saps your energy?
- How would you describe your dream job?
